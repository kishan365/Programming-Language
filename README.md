# MyCustomProgrammingLanguage

A custom programming language and compiler developed to explore how programming languages like Python are implemented. Designed for educational purposes and to understand compiler design, parsing, and execution flow.

## Features
- Custom syntax supporting variables, loops, and functions
- Lexer and parser implementation
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation and interpretation
- Error handling and debugging support
- Written in Python/C++ (specify your language)

## Purpose
This project was created to:
- Understand compiler fundamentals
- Learn tokenization and parsing techniques
- Explore execution flow and runtime behavior
- Gain hands-on experience with language design and interpreters

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
